Javascript Framework Testing
======
### Current Status
Mithril: 

- Routing works
- Loading pages from server works
- Adding comments works
- Comments create logs
- TODO: Wiki
- TODO : Project files organization
- TODO: Making sure everything is the Mithril way. 

This project will eventually house several Javascript frameworks through an application that connects several important components of a framework including

- Server connections
- Routing
- Templating
- Two way Binding

As well as looking for easy of use for front end development for issues such as 

- Rendering DOM elements
- show/hide and other view options
- injection of logic into the template
- Learning curve for templating solutions
- Modularity and reusability of layout elements
- Compatibility with external themes 

Road Map for frameworks to be used:

- Mithril.js
- Can.js
- Knockout.js + Component etc. 
(also potentially)
+ Vue.js + Component etc. 
+ Only jquery
